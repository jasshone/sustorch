# sustorch
This is a fun side project where the goal is to reproduce a lot of the functionality of torch using only numpy functions and no AI assistance/code assistance. (reading papers/looking up math is ok!) The general goal is to make it so for most of the functionality of torch, you can do "import sustorch.module.function" and get what the desired outcome of the torch function is (no gpu support yet).
